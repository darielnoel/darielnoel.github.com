##The Sentence

Sentence -> Clauses, Clauses

## The Clause

Clause -> S+V (Any combination of Subject + Verb(Tense Verb) )

### Two types of clauses

- Independent

- Dependen(subordinated)

Note: (All sentences in English must have an **independent clause**)

#### Independent Clauses

- **(SVO)**   Subject + Verb + Object
- **(SVSc)**  Subject + Verb + Subject complement
- **SVC(A)**  Subject + Verb + Complement(Adverbio)

##### Subject + Verb + Object

**Object**

The object always answers a question about the verb.

- Direct Object

  (What or Whom)

- Indirect Object

  (to/for What)
          Whom

- Transitive verb

  Most take an object

**Example**

- :( I want

It's not a correct english clause because the object is not here.

- :) I want candy.

- :) She gave Mary a letter.

**Subject** - She
**Verb** - gave
**Direct Object** - a letter (What she gave?)
**Indirect Object** - Mary   (To whom?)

##### Subject + Verb + Subject Complement

Subject complement completes the meanings of something.

Specifically complets the meaning of the subject.

Answer the question **(What)**.

When we use the **be** verb we can stablish an equal relationship between **Subject Complement** and **Subject**.

Example:

 I am Canadian.
   =

Example 2:

The waterman must be wrong about today's forecast.

**Subject** - The waterman
**Verb** - be
**Subject complement** - wrong(What be the waterman)
**about today's forecast**- Complement to wrong


##### Subject + Verb + Complement(Adverbio)

  -Adverbial: when?, where?, how?, why? about the verb

  The complement here, completes the meaning of the verb.

Example 1:

 I went to the store.

**Subject** - I
**Verb** - went
**Complement** - to the store(Where I went??)

## Definitions

- Tense Verb

:) - Present, Past, Future, etc

:( - No base verb or infinitive
